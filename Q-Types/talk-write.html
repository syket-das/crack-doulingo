                                        I love listening music, so I like many songs.
                                        However, one of my favourite songs that I want
                                        to talk about is "Hall of Fame" by the script and Will.i.am.
                                        This song was written for the 2012 Olympic Games.
                                        When it came out, It quickly became a hit on every single
                                        music chart throughtout the world, not just because it's catchy melody,
                                        but also its meaningful lirics. The song talks about how each can be a champion
                                        or anything we want to be as long as we dedicate our time and efforts to doing
                                        what we are passionate. The song is played at big athletic events to pump up the
                                        crowd,
                                        but you can easily relate to the song at other times as well, especially when
                                        you are about to
                                        give up.
                                        I think this song has such a powerful message that whenever I was tired or had
                                        decieded to quit, It would
                                        lift me up right away. It made me think about why I had
                                        started in the first place and that I needed to finish the job that I was
                                        currently doing.

                                        Well, thank you sir for providing me this cue card. And my topic is about a technological gadget that I tend to use.
                                        
                                        Frankly speaking, in my entire life, I have got so many opportunities so as to use a variety of technological gadgets.
                                        But, today I would like to talk about a very special gadget which is nothing but a mobile phone that was gifted by my
                                        father at one of my birthday parties.
                                        
                                        Actually, there is an increasing number of reasons why I use this particular gadget. At the very outset of the speech, I
                                        would like to say that with the help of this particular tool, I can have easy access in order to keep in touch with my
                                        family members along with my friends. Another most important point is that as this particular device tends to have a
                                        wide range of entertainment sources, I can watch and listen to a variety of songs that have a catchy tune. Last but not
                                        least, it also has an opportunity to surf the internet that incredibly helps me out to perform my daily affairs.

                                        As I consider myself a bookworm, so you can say I love to read books. Whenever I can manage some spare time. The
                                        interesting thing is that a friend of mine is very enthusiastic about reading all kinds of books . and, he was the
                                        person who recommended it to me.
                                        
                                        Certainly, there appear to a significant number of reasons why I love to read books. At the very outset of my speech, I
                                        would like to say that this book tells a story about a genius person. With the help of reading this particular book, I
                                        can come to learn how to become a genius. Another most striking point is that in a one-word I can say that the writer of
                                        this book is very creative. For example so as to write this particular book, he used a wide range of sentence structures
                                        along with a variety of standard vocabularies. This is how I can increase my English skill.

                                        Well, thank you sir for providing me this cue card. And my topic is about a restaurant where I like to go.
                                        
                                        Fortunately, I have got a good number of opportunities so as to go to a wide range of restaurants which are really
                                        standard enough. But today I would like to talk about a very special restaurant where I tend to go to twice a week
                                        together with my friends as it is located next to my house. It’s one of the most popular restaurants in my city and the
                                        name of this restaurant is KFC.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        In fact, there is an increasing number of reasons why I really prefer to go. At the very outset of my speech, I would
                                        like to say that the interior decoration of this restaurant seems to be lively as it has been embellished with a variety
                                        of eye-catching traditional documentaries along with various types of colourfull lights. Another most important point is
                                        that they also serve a wide range of savory foods which are really mooth watering. Another worth mentioning point is
                                        that whenever I pay a visit to this restaurant, I tend to find some outstanding staff who are always welcoming and try
                                        hard and soul to serve the foods. Last but not least, the prices of their foods are comparatively reasonable compared to
                                        other restaurants.

                                        in my entire life, I have got an array of opportunities in order to have a visit to a wide range of places. Some of them
                                        were in my country and some of them were outside of my country. But today I would like to talk about a very special
                                        place that is considered one of the most popular holiday destinations in my country. And, the name of this place is
                                        cox’s bazaar which is located in the southern part of my country.
                                        
                                        Frankly speaking, I can hardly manage some spare time so as to visit anywhere. But a couple of weeks back, I had been
                                        able to allocate a good amount of time for visiting this place along with my family members.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        Actually, there is an increasing number of reasons why I like this place so much. At the very outset of my speech, I
                                        would like to say that it is the longest sea beach in the world. For example, when I stand on the bank of this
                                        particular sea, I can hardly find the last point of this sea as there is no ending point of it. Another most important
                                        point is that I came across a stunning landscape where I sat for a while In order to relax. Another worth mentioning
                                        point is that when I was starving hungry, I ate different kinds of delicious seafood which were mouth-watering as well.
                                        Last but not least, I also got some amazing individuals who helped me a lot.

                                        I would like to talk about my favorite classic novel called The Godfather, which is written by a well-known Italian
                                        author, Mario Puzo. I came across this novel when I was trying to find a dictionary at a bookstore. It was published in
                                        hard-cover version and there was a colourful illustration on the front which caught my eye.
                                        At first, although I was not much impressed by the novel’s preview, I still bought it and started to read the story
                                        right after getting home. Surprisingly, the more I read “The Godfather”, the more it appealed to me. This novel told the
                                        story of an Italian imaginary character named Vito Corleone, who was a mafia boss in America after World War I. What
                                        attracted me in this story was the way the author described Vito’s tricks to survive in a chaotic society.
                                        
                                        Thanks to this novel, I learned a lot about the course of American history in that lawless period. After finishing this
                                        book, I read some more novels by Mario Puzo and they were all fascinating. I realize that reading books is a good way to
                                        gain knowledge; therefore, everyone should get into the habit of reading.

                                        An indoor game that I liked to play when I was a child was badminton. I started playing the game when I was in the 6th
                                        grade. At that time, I was living near my uncle’s house. Every morning, he would take me and my cousins to the sports
                                        centre near our house. We attended a badminton class. So we had teachers and other students too. We practiced badminton
                                        for an hour every day. During the summer holidays, we would stay for another half an hour. Just like tennis, you can
                                        play badminton as a singles match or a doubles match. The rules are pretty much the same as tennis. The only difference
                                        is that the badminton shuttlecock is lighter than the tennis ball, thus, it requires less strength.Due to my
                                        short-sightedness, I was not very good at playing this game but I enjoyed it anyway. It helped to keep me fit. In
                                        addition, I could train my eyes to look further and faster, and it quickened my reflexes.Sample Answer 2I was never an
                                        outdoorsy kid and vastly preferred paying video games and board games too.Unlike many video games, which can be played
                                        solo, board games require at least one other participant. Monopoly is no exception. It was one of my favorites because
                                        it combined strategy and lighthearted fun. One of the last times I played Monopoly was with a best friend from school.
                                        He had a reputation for being a sore loser, but I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and play with him
                                        anyway.We started the game and it seemed to proceed as normal, until his luck nosedived and he started to lose. It was
                                        obvious he was becoming visibly upset, having gotten too invested in the game. In spite of this I tried to enjoy it
                                        without antagonizing him.His facial expression quickly contorted further and he did something I’d never seen him do
                                        before: flip the board. All the pieces went flying and it was clear the game was over.It took a few moments for it to
                                        sink in. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Without saying a word he stormed off, leaving me to clean up the mess he’d made.A
                                        few days later I saw him in school again. He sheepishly apologized for what happened and suggested we try to find
                                        different non-competitive activities to do together instead.

                                        I would like to talk about a Japanese restaurant I read about on a food blogger’s website. The restaurant named X
                                        located in an alley on ABC Street which is popular with lovers of Japanese food. As I live in XYZ, I can’t go to that
                                        restaurant on a regular basis. Thus, every time I get chance, I love to get there with my colleagues to enjoy a
                                        palatable meal.
                                
                                        
                                        This restaurant serves some kinds of Japanese traditional food. Among them, “ramen” – a traditional noodle of Japanese
                                        is the most sought-after dish by this restaurant’s customers. It offers some famous kinds of ramen, with self-made
                                        noodle, making a wonderful and true ramen taste. The other thing which makes me fall in love with this restaurant is the
                                        Japanese culture when I eat out there. Chefs and waiters are always kind and polite, but smoking or too much noise is
                                        never allowed there. Thus, as soon as you get into the restaurant, it seems like you are immediately brought to Japan to
                                        experience the cuisine and the culture. That’s why it’s enjoyable to be there though it is located in a small area.
                                        
                                        Despite the fact that I really love our country’s cuisine, sometimes I choose to enjoy food from other cultures, and
                                        Japan is always at the top of the list. The art of Japanese cuisine, and the cozy ambience this restaurant creates do
                                        impress me a lot.

                                        Science has made an immense contribution in uplifting human society. Science is not just a subject but plays an
                                        important role in every aspect of our lives. There are various branches of science, including Physics, Chemistry, and
                                        Biology. It is only through science that we are able to know about the diseases and it’s cure. Well, the subject in
                                        which I was interested was Biology. (How did you learn about it?) My science teacher was exceptionally knowledgeable who
                                        took classes in an interactive manner. She introduced me to Biology. The subject usually deals with living organisms and
                                        their vital processes, and it gives in-depth knowledge and understanding of the natural world. (Why are you interested
                                        in it?) The human body is a piece of amazing machinery, and I am very keen to know about the human body and its facts.
                                        Every living thing inculcates different biological systems and functions. And some of the biological facts just blow our
                                        minds. I hope to become a biology professor one day.

                                        I have attended so many birthday parties, but the one I remember the best is my grandfather’s birthday when he turned
                                        80. That celebration is one of the best memories I can keep about him.
                                        To people in our country, 80 years old is a special milestone in everyone’s life as the old people are respected for
                                        their experience and wisdom. Thus, in the 80th birthday celebration, people often hold a big and extremely memorable
                                        party, inviting a lot of people to attend. Among the invitees, there were a lot of our relatives, neighbors, friends and
                                        local authorities.
                                        
                                        My grandfather’s 80th birthday celebration took place in a convention near his house. It was such a quality time for my
                                        whole family and all our beloved relatives and friends to sit together. Everyone tried to choose a special gift for my
                                        grandpa. I was a little bit astonished when I saw the number of gifts my grandpa received, which meant how much my
                                        grandpa was loved. People also sent greetings to him, which are mostly about health. Then, people enjoyed the party with
                                        delicious and well-prepared food.
                                        
                                        However, the most lovely part of the celebration was the time after party. When all of invitees had left, our family
                                        gathered together and took a trip down memory lane. It reminded me of the good old days, when I was knee high to a
                                        grasshopper and still a little stubborn girl who always got into trouble. No matter how big a problem I got into, I
                                        could always ask my grandpa for helps or advice as he would never turn his back on me.
                                        
                                        Time flies so fast, but memory still lasts. Grandpa and his 80th birthday celebration would definitely be one of my
                                        sweetest memories.
