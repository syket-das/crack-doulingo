                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">What is Doulingo English Test</h2>


                        <p>

                            The Duolingo English Test is an online exam that candidates can take on their personal
                            computers. Candidates need to
                            prove English language proficiency can give the Duolingo English Test which can be taken
                            online from anywhere anytime.
                            Like conventional study abroad exams TOEFL, IELTS and PTE, it also tests all the four
                            language skills Reading, Writing,
                            Listening, and Speaking. In this post, we will inform you of everything about the Duolingo
                            test and whether you should
                            take it or not.

                            The test is adaptive which means the difficulty level of the test increases with every
                            correct answer and the next
                            question becomes easier if your answer is wrong. Although the test duration is only around
                            an hour but only with few
                            questions it can test the ability of the test taker quickly.

                            Candidates can take the test from their home and no appointment needed for taking the test,
                            as candidates can take it
                            anytime anywhere as per their convenience. It also has an upgraded section where candidates
                            can take a video interview
                            of 10 minutes and record their answers to open-ended questions.</p>




                        <h2>Why Duolingo English Test?</h2>
                        <p>In this time of COVID-19 crisis when students are not able to give the English Language
                            Proficiency exams in the test
                            center, Duolingo offers them the opportunity to attempt the test from their homes. Although
                            not all the colleges are
                            accepting the Duolingo test scores.

                            Currently, the Duolingo exam is majorly used for admission to undergraduate programs in the
                            US. IELTS and TOEFL exams
                            are accepted by thousands of programs. Also, with Duolingo, one can send scores to as many
                            educational institutions as
                            one wants for free, whereas, with IELTS and TOEFL exams one has to pay a $20 fee for sending
                            score reports to any
                            educational institution other than what they are allowed at the time of registration.</p>


                        <h3>How can I take the Duolingo test?</h3>
                        <p>You can take the test online anywhere, anytime. Candidates need not travel to a test center
                            for attempting this test.

                        <h2>Difference between Duolingo English Test and TOEFL Exam</h2>
                        <p>The items of the Duolingo test are often brief in comparison to other English Language
                            Proficiency Exams. Whereas, the
                            TOEFL exam focuses on scenarios you are going to witness in the real world particularly in
                            academics. Also, questions in
                            the TOEFL exam are divided into different sections of Reading, Writing, Listening, and
                            Speaking whereas the Duolingo
                            test includes all types of questions in one exam. This also means you have to adapt quickly
                            to solve the next question.
                            If one question tests your Reading skills then the other one may test your Listening skills.
                            Also, the Duolingo test is
                            adaptive which means the difficulty level of questions is related to the previous question,
                            whereas, in the TOEFL exam,
                            the difficulty level does not have anything with your previous answers.</p>



                        <h2>Difference between Duolingo English Test and IELTS Exam</h2>

                        <p>Dulolingo test can be given in one attempt whereas the IELTS exam is given generally over a
                            two- day period. Also, there
                            are various differences in the format of both the exams. Although both the exams test all
                            the four skills of the English
                            language, however, you will not see long texts in the Duolingo exam. IELTS exam tests the
                            candidate through essay
                            questions, short answer, and multiple-choice questions while the Duolingo test the
                            candidate's ability on the use of
                            intonation and knowledge of idioms.</p>



                        <h2>What happens after the test</h2>
                        <p>Once you complete the test, it is sent to the proctors and the candidate receives an email
                            stating when he will get the
                            scores (48 hours). When the scores are ready, the candidate is notified through an email.
                            Candidates can take two
                            certified tests within a 30-day period. A certified test is a usual test that you give and
                            get scores. If, in case you
                            face any technical issue during the exam, it will not be count against the two-time limit.

                            Duolingo scores are valid for two years. Once you receive your scores you can send it to the
                            educational institutions
                            straight from the results page and there is no limit of sending the score reports. You can
                            send the score report to as
                            many institutions you want.</p>
